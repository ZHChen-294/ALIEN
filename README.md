* An attention-guided collaborative network for 3D gastric cancer segmentation in CT images.
* Multi-attention fusion module enhances the encoding capacity, addressing the issue of over-segmentation.
* Cross-resolution fusion module facilitates the simultaneous capture of detailed and high-level semantic information.
* Scale-aware activation module selectively extracts and integrates specific patterns from decoded features for feature refinement.
* Submitted to [**Biomedical Signal Processing and Control**](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/biomedical-signal-processing-and-control) (In Revision).
